      I am a passionate <strong>software and game developer</strong>, currently finishing my 
      <strong>Bachelor’s Degree in Video Game Design and Development</strong> at the University of Barcelona (ENTI). 
      My academic and personal projects span from building <strong>custom graphic engines</strong> in <strong>C++</strong> and 
      <strong>OpenGL</strong>, to developing <strong>multiplayer systems</strong> with <strong>network programming</strong>, and 
      designing modern <strong>web applications</strong> with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and <strong>Astro</strong>. 
      I strongly apply <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong>, <strong>SOLID principles</strong>, and <strong>Agile methodologies</strong> 
      to ensure clean, scalable, and maintainable solutions.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base md:text-md text-[color:var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4">
      Beyond the technical side, my journey as a <strong>tennis coach</strong> has been fundamental in shaping my soft skills. 
      Teaching and managing groups of children of all ages allowed me to grow as a <strong>problem-solver</strong>, since tennis 
      is a sport defined by constant mistakes and challenges. Acting not only as a coach, but also as a 
      <strong>mediator</strong> and <strong>coordinator</strong>, strengthened my abilities in <strong>leadership</strong>, 
      <strong>communication</strong>, and <strong>conflict resolution</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base md:text-md text-[color:var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4">
      Sports are an essential part of my life and identity. I competed in <strong>tennis for over 15 years</strong>, 
      and when I decided to stop, I immediately transitioned into <strong>padel competitions</strong>. 
      For me, <strong>competition is not an obligation, but a lifestyle</strong>—a way to cultivate <strong>discipline</strong>, 
      <strong>resilience</strong>, and <strong>ambition</strong>. Facing challenges on the court has taught me to approach 
      professional and personal projects with the same mindset: to never settle, to analyze problems strategically, 
      and to embrace them as opportunities to improve.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base md:text-md text-[color:var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4">
      This unique combination of <strong>technical expertise</strong> and <strong>sports-driven values</strong> defines how I work: 
      ambitious, structured, adaptable, and always motivated to push limits—whether in <strong>software development</strong>, 
      <strong>game design</strong>, or any <strong>team endeavor</strong> I join.
